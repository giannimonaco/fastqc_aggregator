This script, given a directory, will scrape all subdirectories for fastQC output
 files (called "fastqc_data") and generate R code as output which, when piped through R,
 generates compiled data plots.

 USAGE: process_experiment.pl <directory_with_fastqc_outputs> <outputdir> | R --slave
 INPUT: a directory (first argument) that has multiple output files from FastQC for 
	different samples
 OUTPUT: a directory (second argument) created by the script if it doesn't exist with the html 
	and a subdirectory for the PNG images.

 Example:
 ./process_experiment.pl /data/experiment/103R ~/output | R --slave

N.B. At this time, you need to run the program from inside the directory where the
process_experiment script is located.
